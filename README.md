# ðŸ–¼ ReFrame
ðŸ–¼ ReFrame is a private and self-hostable front-end for a popular image sharing app (which doesn't track its users at all, of course [[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Facebook)) owned by a huge corporation which totally doesn't sue people criticising them [[source]](https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/20/eff_letter_to_facebook_re_friendly.pdf)[[source]](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/opinion/facebook-misinformation.html)[[source]](https://firebot-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/email-attachments/9ceab4da-d016-4524-bffc-87519d5e2cce/Barinsta_-_C26D.pdf)[[source]](https://algorithmwatch.org/en//instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook).

## FAQ

**How does it work?**

As written in https://libredirect.github.io/faq.html, https://imginn.com/ isn't really private (the website also looks weirdly structured). So I decided to code a bit...
And this is the result - more or less a Imginn proxy, which is (hopefully) not ugly (maybe).

**Selfhostable?**

Yes.

**How?**

Go figure.
